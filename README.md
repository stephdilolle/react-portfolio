# Portfolio

## Description

I created a portfolio website to collect all of my projects in one place. \
I hope to add to this portfolio as I move through the course and use it to display my work to potential employers. \
I have reconfigured this portfolio using Vite and React.

## Usage

I ran npm create vite and followed the steps to create a Vite template. \
Then I used npm run build to create a dist folder and deployed the site to Netlify. \
Technologies used: Vite and React

Deployed App: https://66ac06997275d777e6978650--helpful-bavarois-100dc4.netlify.app/
